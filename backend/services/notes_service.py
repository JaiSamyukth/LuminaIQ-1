2. **Key Concepts & Definitions** - Each concept gets its own subsection (### heading) with a clear definition, explanation, and an example. Present core definitions in a Markdown **table** with columns: | Term | Definition | Example |.
3. **Detailed Explanations** - Deep-dive into each major topic. Use subheadings (###), numbered steps for processes, and bullet points for supporting details. Include at least 2-3 paragraphs per major concept.
4. **Relationships & Connections** - A section explaining how the concepts relate to each other. Use a comparison table if there are contrasting ideas: | Aspect | Concept A | Concept B |.
5. **Real-World Examples & Applications** - At least 3 concrete examples showing how the theory applies in practice.
6. **Common Misconceptions** - List 3-5 things students often get wrong about this topic and the correct understanding.
7. **Summary & Key Takeaways** - Numbered list of the 8-12 most important points to remember.

### Formatting rules:
- Use proper Markdown: #, ##, ###, **bold**, *italic*, `code` where appropriate.
- Include at least **2 tables** (definitions table + comparison/relationship table).
- Use > blockquotes for important definitions or formulas.
- Total length: **minimum 1000 words**, aim for 1200-1500 words.
- Write in a clear, educational tone suitable for university students.

2. **Categorized Sections** - Group facts under clear ## section headings (e.g., "## Definitions", "## Core Principles", "## Processes & Mechanisms", "## Key Figures & Data", "## Relationships & Comparisons").
3. Under each section, use hierarchical bullets:
   - **Main bullet** (- ) for primary facts — start each with a **bold key term** followed by a colon and the explanation.
     - *Sub-bullet* for supporting details, examples, or exceptions.
     - *Sub-bullet* for related formulas, dates, or figures.

### Content rules:

- Each bullet must be a self-contained, meaningful fact — not vague summaries.
- If there are processes or sequences, use numbered sub-lists (1. 2. 3.) under the parent bullet.
- Include a final section: **## Quick-Review Checklist** — 8-10 yes/no self-test questions (e.g., "Can I explain X?").

   |---|------|-----------|-------------------|
   Number each row sequentially. The Definition column must be 1-3 clear sentences. The Context column gives a usage example or explains when/where the term appears.

3. **Grouped Terminology** (after the table) — Organize the same terms into logical category groups (e.g., "### Process Terms", "### Measurement Terms", "### Theoretical Concepts") with a 1-sentence definition each. This helps students see which terms belong together.

4. **Acronyms & Abbreviations** — If any exist, list them in a separate small table:
   | Abbreviation | Full Form | Meaning |

5. **Relationships Between Terms** — A short paragraph or bullet list explaining how 3-5 key terms connect to or depend on each other.

### Content rules:
- Extract **every** technical term, concept name, proper noun, and specialized word from the source material.
- Aim for **at least 15-25 terms** (more if the material is terminology-heavy).
- Definitions must be precise and self-contained — a student should understand the term from the definition alone.
- Sort the main table **alphabetically** by Term.
- Use **bold** for the term when it first appears, *italic* for related terms referenced within definitions.

3. **## Key Principles & Rules** — Numbered list of the core rules, laws, or principles. Each gets ONE line — be maximally concise.

4. **## Comparison Tables** — Side-by-side comparisons of easily confused concepts:
   | Feature | Concept A | Concept B |

5. **## Process Checklists** — Any step-by-step processes as numbered checklists.

6. **## Common Pitfalls & Traps** — 5-8 bullet points of mistakes examiners test for:
   - **Wrong**: [common misconception] → **Right**: [correct understanding]

7. **## Memory Aids** — 2-4 mnemonics, acronyms, or memory tricks to remember key sequences or lists.

8. **## Last-Minute Review** — The absolute top 10 facts to read 5 minutes before the exam, as a numbered list. Each must be one sentence.

### Formatting rules:
- Maximum density — no filler words, no long explanations.
- Use **bold** aggressively for key terms.
- Use `code formatting` for formulas and technical notation.
- Use > blockquotes for formulas and critical rules.
- Use tables wherever possible for compact presentation.
